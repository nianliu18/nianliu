        Ever since I was young I always loved tinkering with the social media platforms such as Xanga where I designed my own HTML and searched for cool music play boxes to embedd on my sites. Since then technology had always excited me and kept me current with tech. My dive into web development didn't fully happen until I met a software engineer in Taiwan. He explained to me how powerful JavaScript and the React library can be and the many doorways software engineering can open up. Thats when I started to immerse myself deeper into coding by playing with flappy bird browser game tutorials, website design classes from code academy and introduction classes on JavaScript through youtube. My hunger to learn grew a step further when  I challenged myself to taking a coding prep course from App Academy which reinforced me with a deeper understanding of JS functions, algorithms, and problem solving capabilities. My journey only took steps further by joining an immersive three month booth camp through General Assembly which taught to work with teams that leaned on each other for help and equipped me with experience and knowledge on building functioning full stack apps today.

        My time at Verizon has been valuable and cultivating. This company has equipped me with the skills to adapt to constantly changing environments, to think quickly and effectively when faced with day to day challanges. Guess that's why they gave us the title Solutions Specialist because we were always on our toes and had to be comfortable solving problems when we see them. This role previously had prepared me well when entering into the tech/development scene because we too face day to day challenges and it takes patience and diligence to overcome hurdles that come our way. What I also valued from this experience was the reinforcing my communication skills from connecting to customers and professionally attending to their needs and concerns. While working in sales or in tech, soft skills are highly needed to successfully needed to complete daily tasks and agendas, this is why Verizon was a valuable spending stone towards me now current role as a web developer.
